# pilot_import_csv
Imports Pilots into Rotorhazard from a csv file

Works with Wordpress registration forms created with WP Forms 7 and Contact Form CFDB7 or Flamingo.
Potentially this also works with Google Forms or other quick Forms Webapplications - this will be tested soon.
This enables a very easy race organisation without the need of further infrastructure.

Hope this helps you!
